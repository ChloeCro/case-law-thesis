class TfidfKMeansClusterer:
    """
    A class that combines TF-IDF vectorization with K-Means clustering to segment legal document headers.

    This class implements a semi-supervised approach to cluster headers from legal documents into predefined categories
    using TF-IDF features and K-Means clustering. The approach leverages seed embeddings based on legal topic keywords
    to guide the clustering process towards meaningful groupings.

    Attributes:
        vectorizer (TfidfVectorizer): A TF-IDF vectorizer used to transform text data into numerical vectors.
        kmeans_model (KMeans): A K-Means clustering model that partitions the TF-IDF vectors into clusters.
        seed_embeddings (dict): A dictionary containing seed word embeddings to initialize the K-Means centroids.

    Methods:
        fit_transform(headers: List[str]) -> pd.DataFrame:
            Vectorizes the input headers using TF-IDF and applies K-Means clustering to segment the headers.

        refine_tfidf_vectors(labeled_data: pd.DataFrame) -> dict:
            Creates refined TF-IDF vectors for each cluster using labeled data, emphasizing cluster-specific features.

        assign_clusters(new_headers: List[str]) -> List[int]:
            Assigns new, unlabeled headers to clusters based on the similarity to the refined TF-IDF vectors.

        evaluate_clustering(headers: List[str], labels: List[int]) -> dict:
            Evaluates the quality of clustering using metrics like Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index.
